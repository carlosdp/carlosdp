## Interest Areas

### Generative User Interfaces

I strongly believe the future of user interfaces in computing will look like:

```
User Input (tap,click,etc.) -> AI Model -> Pixels on Screen
```

We're probably also closer to that future than we think, but the last 10% (mainly, making it fast, performant, and cheap) may take a while, even after the capability exists. In the meantime, I'm working on projects that approximate that user experience as close as possible using code generation for user interfaces.

What do apps look like / feel like in a world where the UI isn't predefined by their developers? What becomes better / worse? What are the new challenges this new paradigm brings for developers and users, and what does "design" look like in this new world?

### Better Broadcasting for E-Sports

It should follow that as video games become more and more popular and pervasive, the audience of people that watch competitive gamers should grow. That _has_ been happening, but I think there's something holding this field back that has been bugging me, and that is the broadcast experience.

There's just something that feels "disconnected" from the action when broadcasters are looking at the standard game's UI in a spectator view, context that is lost and makes it hard to be entertained by what's happening, unless you are such an expert in the game in question that you can parse the situation easily.

You don't need to be an expert in (American üá∫üá∏) football to enjoy watching a game of football, or to understand when something really impressive just happened (someone just caught a really long pass, for example). In video games, the visuals we see are rarely as simple as a field where one team is trying to bring a ball to one side of the field, and the other team wants it to go the other direction.

I think that generative AI provides an opportunity to, in real time, create media that makes "what is going on in the game right now" more approachable to viewers, and expand the audience of people that would enjoy watching experts play a game of Starcraft or Valorant, for example.

### Robotics (WIP)

I think this new resurgence in results in robotics, stemming largely from integration with VLMs and other transformers, is really cool. I've wanted to work on hardware projects for a while ("something _real_, actually _in the world_"), but my career has almost exclusively been in software thus far.

I'm slowly building up skills at home to work on hardware projects and robotics in the future. I think there's a large field of areas that are now more practical to solve problems in with robotics, and I want to be part of that.

## Past

In quick summary (past to present):

### Carnegie Mellon University

Studied there, also helped run the student theatre üé≠ group and got obsessed with that. Ran the software for student government elections, as well.

### Mozilla

Was an intern on a cloud team working on FirefoxOS ü™¶, originated the [Background Sync API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Synchronization_API) along with my boss

### Twilio

Interned there when it was sub-100 people, joined full-time after college at 300 people on the API Team, and was there through the IPO and saw it scale eventually to 4000 people.

My biggest projects were:

- [Yoyodyne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ3OtuAt9IQ&t=2s&pp=ygUbdHdpbGlvIGNvZGUgdGhhdCBjb2RlcyBjb2Rl): The thing that generates all Twilio REST libraries, docs, server endpoints, end-to-end tests, etc. We basically automated out the day-to-day job of our team, and they moved us internal to the organization to do the same for an aging internal platform.
- Platform v2: Helped architect and build Twilio's v2 internal cloud platform. Twilio started right as "cloud" started to become a thing, was one of the first startups to build on top of AWS EC2 instead of its own hardware. So, it obviously had a real mess of scripts managing its deployment and CI, up til then, which was not easy to migrate to something new. I helped come up with the plan, and implementation, to migrate Twilio's infrastructure to more resilient and modern deployment schemes, without too much developer burden for teams.

### Penrose Studios

Think Pixar, but in virtual reality. I created the first production-grade in-VR animation tool, along with a cool bunch of ex-Pixar/Dreamworks engineers and animators, and worked on some in-VR animated films such as _Allumette_ and _Tide's Wake_.

### Zeal

A short-lived startup where we were trying to create a "TurboTax, but for running for local office". Silly idea, and absolutely no way to make money, but we got to do a YC interview, which was a cool experience!

### Garnet

A startup that provided a no-code "custom Zoom", for specialized Zoom-like video calls (think like, one for lawyers might have a widget for dictating the call, etc. Surely Zoom couldn't handle _all_ use cases, right?... right?)

Turns out people only needed Zoom ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Metaphor

A pivot from Garnet, building community software for DAOs, specifically on top of Ethereum.

Was fun, but yea DAOs didn't really happen (at least not yet)

### Raza (today)
